when ever a Linux system CPU is occupied by a process, it is unavailable for processing other requests. 
Rest of pending requests must wait till CPU is free. This becomes a bottleneck in the system.
Following command will help you to identify CPU utilization,
so that you can troubleshoot CPU related performance problems on a Linux based system.

Finding CPU utilization is one of the important tasks. Linux comes with various utilities to report CPU utilization.
1) CPU utilization
2) Display the utilization of each CPU individually (SMP cpu)
3) Find out your system’s average CPU utilization since the last system reboot
4) Determine which process is eating the CPU(s)

Top command to find out Linux cpu usage
$ top

The top command produces a frequently-updated list of processes. 
By default, the processes are ordered by percentage of CPU usage, with only the “top” CPU consumers shown.
The top command shows how much processing power and memory are being used, 
as well as other information about the running processes.

 ***mpstat and other tools***
 
 Need to install :
 ------------------------
 apt-get install sysstat
 
 //if error check this link https://crybit.com/sysstat-sar-on-ubuntu-debian/
 
 Display the utilization of each CPU individually using mpstat
 
 The mpstat command display activities for each available processor, processor 0 being the first one.
 Global average activities among all processors are also reported. 
 The mpstat command can be used both on SMP and UP machines,
 but in the latter, only global average activities will be printed.
  
  mpstat -P ALL
  
 Report CPU utilization using the sar command
You can display today's CPU activity, with sar command:
sar

COMPARISON OF CPU UTILIZATION

sar -u 2 5

-u 12 5 : Report CPU utilization. The following values are displayed:
%user: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level (application).
%nice: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the user level with nice priority.
%system: Percentage of CPU utilization that occurred while executing at the system level (kernel).
%iowait: Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle during which the system had an outstanding disk I/O request.
%idle: Percentage of time that the CPU or CPUs were idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk I/O request.

Task: Find out who is monopolizing or eating the CPUs
Finally, you need to determine which process is monopolizing or eating the CPUs. 
Following command will displays the top 10 CPU users on the Linux system.
# ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -k 1 -r | head -10
or 
# ps -eo pcpu,pid,user,args | sort -r -k1 | less
