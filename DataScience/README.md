**Topic 3: Matplotlib** 
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats 
and interactive environments across platforms.


**Topic 4: Machine Learning (Scikit Learn)**
Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. 
The machine learns from the large set of training data and helps to predict or classify on the new dataset.
It is classified into following two categories:
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, Recommender systems).
